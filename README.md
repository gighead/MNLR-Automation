# MNLR-Automation
This repositary contains all the scripts that are need for the MNLR test and implementation.

Inputs to the script:
====================
1. Feed the rspec file to the script (Preferrably keeo the script in the same location)
2. The script will prompt for the username( R.I.T username)
3. The script will prompt for the location of your local MNLR script ?


What the Script does for you?
=============================

1. The script parses the rspec , which is a xml file and collects the info and write it as a dictionary in to a text file.
2. Reads the input and gets the script from the location 
3. SCP the latest MNLR code to all the GENI nodes extracted from the rspec file

MNLR Command Construction needs to be done. Work in Progress
